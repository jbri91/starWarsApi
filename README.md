# Summary

This project was very challenging. I learned a lot more about React from this project. Initially, passing props and using them was a hard concept to understand for me. This time around, it just clicked and I was able to move data from the App.js to the pagination.js and table.js. I also learned about API's and fetching data in order to render it on the page using a table. Fetching data within fetching data was fun to play with. Home World and Species were populating as URL's so I had to fetch them separately before I can render it on the table. Before I started the project, it was a bit intimidating as I didn't know what a lot of the things it was asking for were. After, I read through some documentation and googled to learn, it wasn't as bad as I thought. This definitely helped show me how far I have come with thinking as a programmer and asking the right questions to find the answers!

Right before finishing the app, I came across another issue but this time with Heroku. They block any HTTP requests. It took a lot of time and researching to find how to get around this but I am ready for the next time. The way I felt here was probably how Al Pacino from the Godfather felt when he said, 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!' Lesson learned! Looking forward to my next project!
